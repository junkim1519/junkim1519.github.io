## Why is asking smart questions important?
The field of software engineering is constantly evolving, and new technologies are always being added.  Because of this, forums such as Stack Overflow have become very popular, and many programmers (including myself) can often find the solution to our problems on there.  However, in order to get a helpful response, it is important to ask your question in a smart way.  This includes clearly identifying your problem, describing the symptoms, and providing any necessary code for others to test.  When questions are not asked in a smart way, in addition to wasting many everyone's time, you are unlikely to find a helpful response because the problem cannot be correctly diagnosed.  Being good at asking smart questions will make it easier to solve your problems and become an overall better software engineer.

## What does a smart question look like?
Here is an example of a smart question asked on Stack Overflow: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap]

The post is titled "What and where are the stack and heap?".  Immediately, we can identify the subject of the question and what the user is asking about it.  This is also not a simple question that can easily be found by looking up a manual - the concept of a stack and heap in computer memory is rather abstract and can be confusing to many people.  In the body of the question, the user uses bullet points to ask a series of questions that go into further detail, such as "Where are they physically located in a computer's memory?".  These questions are concise and straight to the point, and the bullet points make it easy to separate each question and respond to them.  As a result, most of the responses descriptively answer each question, include diagrams, and point the user to further resources.

## What does a not so smart question look like?
Here is an example of a not so smart question: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43762646/how-to-get-on-python-current-time?noredirect=1&lq=1]

The title of the post, "How to get on python current time" is confusing and does not accurately describe the problem.  After reading the body of the question, we find that the user is actually asking a question about date and time formatting, which was not referenced anywhere in the title.  The user does provide some code - they import the Python `datetime` library and show some logic that does not work.  However, as one of the responses pointed out, simply reading the documentation of the `datetime` library shows that there is an easy solution to the problem using the `strftime` library.  This is a question that could have easily been solved by simply reading some basic documentation.  Another response points out that a simple Google search returns many answers about `strftime`.  The response also points the user to a link about [How to ask a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) on Stack Overflow.

## So What?
It is tempting for a beginner to ask a question on Stack Overflow the same way they might ask someone for help in person.  That usually begins with something like "please help me!" followed by a vague description of the problem, in hopes that the person helping them will ask the questions that they need to ask in order to solve the problem.  However, this approach does not work well on Stack Overflow.  On forums, you must accurately and comprehensively describe your problem in a single post so that the people who are browsing that forum feel like they can give a helpful answer.  If this is not done, at best, you will receive a reply pointing you to the proper resources that you should have looked at, and at worst, you may receive no reply at all.
