This is an alternating-turn game I developed in Java where the user can build a custom team of Pokemon and battle against the computer.  It was my first project that uses a GUI instead of being purely text-based.

This project demonstrates:
- Creating a custom Pokemon class to represent Pokemon, including get and set methods **(Pokemon.java)**
- Creating a custom "PokemonException" exception class **(PokemonException.java)**
- Use of GUI tools including java.awt and javax.swing
  - Buttons and ActionListeners
  - Drop-down menus
  - BorderLayout and GridBagLayout
- Use of ArrayLists to hold teams of Pokemon
- Generating random events via random numbers
- Writing and saving files
- Proper JavaDoc comments and documentation
